# Architechture

In our project, the client component will be the mobile app or web application used by the students to access the higher education suggestion system. The app allows students to input their academic history and preferences, view university suggestions, track deadlines, and participate in the forum.

The server component will handle the backend processing of these requests. It will receive data from the client, perform analysis based on the academic history and preferences, generate personalized university suggestions, store user activities and forum interactions, and return the relevant data as responses to the client.

The client-server architecture allows for a clear separation of concerns, making the project easier to maintain and scale. It also facilitates a more efficient distribution of tasks between the client and server components, ensuring a smoother user experience and optimal performance.
